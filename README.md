App in Java that stores databases of students and courses and provides various functionalities:
- creating students
- assigning courses
- creating a student with a list of courses
- printing students
- printing courses

The App uses DAO and DTO design patterns. It can read the students and courses information
either from a file, mySQL database using JDBC, or from a relational database using the
Hibernate Framework/Persistence API.

Also used advanced Java concepts like reflection and annotations for sending messages
dynamically at runtime, based on the annotated fields.

Guided by a Java Software Developer to help me optimise both code clarity and functionality.
The project will be extended in the future with more functionalities:
[TODO] Multithreading
[TODO] Integration with Spring Framework
